This is an indeed application automation utility I wrote to make the process of applying for jobs in tech a little bit less tedious(working smarter not harder). I understand the struggle of constantly applying for jobs to only get a response back from 1 out of every hundreds. That's what this bot is for the people. 

If you came here looking for an application assistant you're in the right place!

If you're interested in contributing the this project or need assistance, please
don't be a stranger I'm open to emails and DM's on any of the socials listed in my 
README

Next you're going to want to ensure you have all the proper files uploaded to your account to make 
the automation process easier. This includes your resume, job preferences, and ready to work status.
This initial work up front may increase your chances of actually getting that hire.
